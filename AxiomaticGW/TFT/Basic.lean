# Two-dimensional topological field theories

`TwoDimensionalTFT` is the finite-labelled correlator presentation of a closed
oriented two-dimensional topological field theory. It records scalar
correlators, their unit, and their one-edge sewing laws. The equivalent
symmetric-monoidal-functor presentation is not constructed here.

Correlators are provided for all genera and all finite label types, including
unstable arities. This makes the counit, metric, and multiplication visible as
low-arity operations and permits a later restriction to stable CohFT arities.

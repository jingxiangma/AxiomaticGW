# Constructions from commutative Frobenius algebras

This file contains the reverse passage from an invariant pairing to a counit,
followed by the finite-free tensors used in two-dimensional TFT formulas.

In a theorem statement, `∀ a b c : A, ...` means "for every `a`, `b`, and
`c` in `A`".  A proof introduced by `by` is tactic-style Lean code: each line
transforms the current goal until no goals remain.

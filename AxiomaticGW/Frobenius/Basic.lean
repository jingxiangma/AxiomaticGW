# Commutative Frobenius algebras

The primitive datum is a Frobenius functional `counit : A -> R`. Its trace
pairing is required to be perfect; symmetry and Frobenius invariance are
derived theorems.

## Design choice

We store only the counit and the proof of perfectness. The pairing is derived
as `η(a, b) = counit (a * b)`. Commutativity of `A` then proves symmetry, and
associativity of multiplication proves Frobenius invariance. Storing all of
these facts independently would introduce redundant data.

The notation `A →ₗ[R] R` means an `R`-linear functional. The notation
`LinearMap.BilinForm R A` means an `R`-bilinear form `A × A → R`, represented
in Lean as a linear map returning another linear map.

/-- The bilinear trace pairing associated to a linear functional.

Mathlib's `LinearMap.mul R A` is multiplication viewed as a bilinear map.
`compr₂ counit` composes its output with the counit, producing
`(a, b) ↦ counit (a * b)`. -/

/-- A commutative Frobenius algebra, presented by its Frobenius functional.

There are only two fields: the functional and perfectness of its trace
pairing. Notice that the assumption that `A` is finite free over `R` is not
built into this structure. It is required later only for constructions, such
as the copairing, that use a finite tensor--Hom equivalence. -/

/-- Two Frobenius structures are equal when their counits are equal. The
remaining fields are proofs, and Lean's proof irrelevance says that two proofs
of the same proposition do not create different structures.

`@[ext]` registers this as an extensionality theorem for later proofs. -/

algebra.

The `where` block constructs the three fields of
`SymmetricPerfectPairing`. Symmetry follows from commutativity; perfectness is
exactly the proof stored in `F`. -/

exactly associativity of multiplication. -/
